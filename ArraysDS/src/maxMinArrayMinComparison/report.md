# Analysis:
Total number of comparisons are 2(n - 1), so time-complexity is O(n)
# Question:
1. This question is sourced from [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-and-minimum-in-an-array/). In C version of the solution they suggest struct or pointers, in the Java version they suggest using a class. Why not an array which is easier to implement?
