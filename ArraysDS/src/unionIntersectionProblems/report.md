# Question:
1. There was a confusion in this one. In excel sheet the question is "Find Union and intersection of two sorted arrays"
2. However, when clicked on the link, the question is "Given two arrays and their sizes, find the count of their union" [link](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/union-of-two-arrays3538/1)
3. So, I have decided to complete both questions with 1st one in MainSheet and 2nd one in MainLink.
